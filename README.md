### What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, understanding, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development and directly impacts the success or failure of a project.

## 📌 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the SDLC. Its importance can be highlighted through these key reasons:

* **1. Ensures Stakeholder Alignment**
  Clarifies expectations and reduces miscommunication by involving end-users, clients, and developers in understanding needs.

* **2. Minimizes Risk and Rework**
  Detects ambiguous or missing requirements early, preventing costly changes later in development.

* **3. Enhances Quality and Testing**
  Provides a clear set of requirements (functional and non-functional), which helps QA teams craft precise test cases and prevents overlooked features.

## 🔧 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Below are the five essential activities performed during requirement analysis:

### • Requirement Gathering

* **Definition**: Collecting raw data about what the stakeholders expect from the system.
* **Examples (Hotel Booking App)**:

  * *Functional*: Users must be able to search hotels by location and date.
  * *Non‑Functional*: The search results page should load in under 2 seconds.

### • Requirement Elicitation

* **Definition**: Probing stakeholders through interviews, workshops, or surveys to uncover unstated needs.
* **Examples**:

  * *Functional*: Admins need to manage room inventory and booking availability.
  * *Non‑Functional*: The system must support at least 10,000 concurrent users.

### • Requirement Documentation

* **Definition**: Creating a formal requirements specification (e.g., SRS) that records all functionality and constraints.
* **Examples**:

  * *Functional*: Users can filter listings by price, ratings, and amenities.
  * *Non‑Functional*: Photos for each listing must be in JPEG/PNG format with max 2MB size.

### • Requirement Analysis and Modeling

* **Definition**: Structuring requirements into models (use cases, data flow diagrams, ER diagrams) to refine and check consistency.
* **Examples**:

  * *Functional*: A use case diagram showing “User → Search → Book → Pay.”
  * *Non‑Functional*: UML activity diagram specifies response-time constraints in the search flow.

### • Requirement Validation

* **Definition**: Confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are clear, achievable, and complete (e.g., via reviews or prototyping).
* **Examples**:

  * *Functional*: Stakeholders agree that “booking confirmation is emailed immediately upon payment.”
  * *Non‑Functional*: Users confirm that the app’s mobile layout works smoothly on devices with screen widths between 320px–760px.

## 📂 Types of Requirements

Requirements in software development are mainly categorized into:

### 🔸 Functional Requirements

Define **what the system should do** — specific features, actions, and behaviors.

**Examples (Hotel Booking App):**

* Users can search and book hotels.
* Hosts can list and manage room availability.
* Admins can approve or remove listings.

### 🔹 Non-Functional Requirements

Define **how the system should perform** — quality attributes like speed, security, and scalability.

**Examples:**

* Search results load within 2 seconds.
* App supports 50,000+ users simultaneously.
